# Icons

In the Arctic Design Kit, we utilize [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com) for all of our icon needs. We specifically use the SVG variant of the icons, ensuring a consistent, high-quality visual appearance across the design system. These icons integrate seamlessly within our component library and provide a modern and versatile look for the user interface.
