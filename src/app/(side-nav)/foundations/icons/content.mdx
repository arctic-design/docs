# Icons

The Arctic Design Kit leverages the `@arctic-kit/icons` package for all icon-related needs. This package provides a comprehensive collection of SVG icons, meticulously crafted to enhance user interfaces and elevate visual communication. Each icon is optimized for modern web applications and seamlessly integrates with React components.

By default, the icons in this package are outline icons and come with a `className` of `"arctic-icon-medium"`, making it simple to apply common styles like width and height through global CSS rules. For example, the icons displayed below have a global width of 24px.

If you prefer solid icons, you can easily import them from `@arctic-kit/icons/solid`. When using solid icons, the `className` will be `"arctic-icon-medium solid"` to maintain consistency while differentiating the icon styles.

**Acknowledgment:** The icons integrated into the Arctic Design Kit are sourced from <a href="https://heroicons.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`@heroicons`</a>, with both solid and outline variants standardized at a 24px size.
