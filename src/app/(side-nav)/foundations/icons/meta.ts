This package provides a collection of SVG icons that seamlessly integrate with React components, enhancing UI and visual communication. Each icon comes with a default `className` of `arctic-icon-medium`, allowing easy application of global styles like width and height through CSS. In the examples below, we've applied a global width of 24px to the icons.",
