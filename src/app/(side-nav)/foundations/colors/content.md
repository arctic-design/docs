## Colors Overview

The color palette in the Arctic Design system is divided into different categories, each represented by a specific type called `ColorType`. These categories include **primary**, **secondary**, **success**, **info**, **warning**, **error**, and **grey**. Each color type has a range of shades, from light to dark, defined by numeric keys such as 50, 100, 200, and so on, up to 900. This ensures a consistent gradient for each color, allowing for flexible usage across different UI elements.

In addition to these colors, the system includes a **neutral** color type defined by `NeutralColorType`. The neutral color is represented by two values: `0` for the lightest shade and `1000` for the darkest shade, providing a balanced contrast between light and dark neutral tones within the system.

This structure ensures a consistent and cohesive visual identity throughout the design system while maintaining flexibility in color usage.
