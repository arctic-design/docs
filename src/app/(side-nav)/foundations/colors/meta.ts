    "The Arctic Design system's color palette is structured into distinct categories using `ColorType`, which includes primary, secondary, success, info, warning, error, and grey, each with a range of shades from light to dark (e.g., 50 to 900). Additionally, the system features a `NeutralColorType` with shades from 0 (lightest) to 1000 (darkest), providing a flexible yet cohesive visual identity for UI elements across the design system.",
