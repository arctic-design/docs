# Foundations of Arctic Design

The **Foundations of Arctic Design** lay the groundwork for a cohesive and scalable design system. These foundations include essential elements such as:

- [**Colors**](/foundations/colors)
- [**Icons**](/foundations/icons)

Each aspect is carefully structured to ensure consistency and flexibility across all UI components. Arctic Design prioritizes accessibility, modern aesthetics, and performance, providing a solid base for building intuitive and visually appealing user experiences. These core principles support seamless collaboration between design and development, enabling scalable and adaptable design across various projects.
