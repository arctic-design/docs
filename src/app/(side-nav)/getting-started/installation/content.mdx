## Installation Guide

Integrate the `@arctic-kit/snow` library into your project by following these steps. This guide covers installation via both `yarn` and `npm`, setting up fonts, configuring styles, and using a component.

### 1. Install

Choose your preferred package manager to install the library.

- **Using Yarn:**

<CodeBlockSection>{`yarn add @arctic-kit/snow`}</CodeBlockSection>

- **Using NPM:**

<CodeBlockSection>{`npm install @arctic-kit/snow`}</CodeBlockSection>

### 2. Fonts Setup

To ensure the components render correctly, include the necessary font files in your project. Instead of using `<link>` tags, we'll use the `@fontsource` package to import the fonts directly into your styles:

- **Install Fontsource Package:**

  - **Using Yarn:**

  <CodeBlockSection>{`yarn add @fontsource/inter`}</CodeBlockSection>

  - **Using NPM:**

  <CodeBlockSection>{`npm install @fontsource/inter`}</CodeBlockSection>

- **Import Fonts in Your Styles:**

  In your project's main stylesheet or root file (like `index.ts` for Vite), add the following imports:

  <FontImportStep />

### 3. Configuration

Import the primary stylesheet to apply the default styles provided by `@arctic-kit/snow`. The method varies based on your project setup:

- **For Vite:**

  In your `main.js` or equivalent entry file, add:

  <CodeBlockSection>{`import '@arctic-kit/snow/style.css';`}</CodeBlockSection>

- **For Next.js:**

  In your `pages/_app.js` or `pages/_app.tsx`, include:

  <CodeBlockSection>{`import '@arctic-kit/snow/style.css';`}</CodeBlockSection>

### 4. Using a Component

Once installed and configured, you can start using components from the library. Here's an example of how to use the `Button` component:

<Example />

By following these steps, you should have `@arctic-kit/snow` seamlessly integrated into your project. For more detailed information and advanced configurations, refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/arctic-kit/snow).
